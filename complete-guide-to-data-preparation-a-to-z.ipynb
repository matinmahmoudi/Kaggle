    "- **employ**: 0 to 31 years - This range covers the typical employment duration for most individuals.\n",
    "- **address**: 0 to 80 years - This range represents the duration someone might live at a given address.\n",
    "- **income**: 0 to 1000 thousand dollars - This upper limit is set to include high-income individuals while excluding outliers.\n",
    "- **debtinc**: 0 to 100 percent - This range covers the debt-to-income ratio, with 100% being the upper logical limit.\n",
    "- **creddebt**: 0 to 30 thousand dollars - This range is set to include typical credit card debt amounts.\n",
    "- **othdebt**: 0 to 30 thousand dollars - This range includes other types of debt and is set to exclude extreme outliers.\n",

    "# Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage poses a significant challenge in the area of machine learning and data analytics, emphasizing the critical importance of a well-considered evaluation design. Data leakage occurs when information from the test set unintentionally influences the training process, leading to over-optimistic model performance. To mitigate this risk, adopting a robust evaluation design becomes imperative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage can manifest in various forms, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train-Test Contamination**: When data from the test set influences the training set, leading to artificially high performance metrics.\n",
    "2. **Temporal Leakage**: Occurs in time-series data when future information is used to predict past events.\n",
    "3. **Feature Leakage**: When features that are highly correlated with the target variable are included in the training data, but would not be available in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent data leakage, it is essential to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clearly Separate Training and Test Data**: Ensure that the training data does not contain any information from the test set. This separation allows for an unbiased evaluation of model performance on unseen data, mimicking real-world scenarios.\n",
    "2. **Use Temporal Split for Time-Series Data**: When working with time-series data, use a temporal split to ensure that past data is used to predict future events.\n",
    "3. **Remove Highly Correlated Features**: Identify and remove features that are highly correlated with the target variable and would not be available in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these principles, we can guard against data leakage and contribute to the development of more reliable and generalizable machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separating Training and Test Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will separate our dataset into training and test sets. This separation is crucial to ensure that the model is evaluated on data it has never seen before, providing an unbiased estimate of its performance. Additionally, we will further separate the continuous and categorical variables within each set to facilitate specific preprocessing steps.\n"

    "# Outlier Detection and Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier is an observation that is unlike the other observations. They are rare, distinct, or do not fit in some way. We generally define outliers as samples that are exceptionally far from the mainstream of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**: In data mining issues involving deviation detection tasks, the identification and management of outliers should be disregarded as part of the data cleaning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier detection is a crucial step in data analysis, employing various methods to identify and manage data points that significantly deviate from expected patterns. There are two main approaches to outlier detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Dimensional Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "One-dimensional methods can be applied only to continuous variables. We will explore two common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Deviation Method**: This method uses the standard deviation from the mean to identify outliers. Values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations are typically considered outliers.\n",
    "2. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method**: This method uses the IQR to define limits on the sample values. Values below the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the IQR or above the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the IQR are considered outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why IQR Method is Better\n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR method is preferred in many cases because it does not assume normality of the data distribution. The standard deviation method assumes the data follows a normal distribution, which may not always be the case. The IQR method is more robust as it uses percentiles and can be applied to non-Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Thresholds and k Values\n",
    "\n",
    "When detecting outliers, the choice of threshold for the standard deviation method and the value of k for the IQR method can vary based on the dataset and business requirements. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation Method**: While 3 standard deviations is a common threshold, smaller datasets might use 2 standard deviations to identify outliers, and larger datasets might use 4 standard deviations to account for greater variability.\n",
    "- **IQR Method**: The common value for k is 1.5, but this can be adjusted to 2 for a stricter outlier detection or 3 to identify extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These adjustments depend on the specific context and goals of the analysis. It's essential to consider the characteristics of the data and the impact of outliers on the analysis and business outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with detected outliers, two common approaches are employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove Rows**: Exclude entire rows containing outliers from the dataset.\n",
    "2. **Coerce to Bounds**: Modify outlier values to fall within an acceptable range, either by setting them to the lower or upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods offer flexibility in managing the impact of outliers on data analysis, allowing analysts to choose the most suitable strategy based on the specific requirements of their analysis.\n"

    "### Multidimensional Method\n",

    "Outlier detection can also be extended to multidimensional datasets where interactions between multiple variables can reveal anomalies that one-dimensional methods might miss. One effective multidimensional method is the Isolation Forest algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Isolation Forest Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Isolation Forest method is a powerful approach to outlier detection that leverages decision trees to isolate outliers. This method isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The fewer the splits required to isolate an observation, the more likely it is an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Isolation Forest**:\n",
    "1. It is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional data.\n",
    "2. It does not rely on assumptions about the data distribution.\n",
    "3. It is efficient and scales well to large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Isolation Forest for Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers in both the training and test sets. This method will help us identify anomalies based on the relationships between multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "After detecting outliers using the Isolation Forest method, we can choose to either remove the corresponding rows from the dataset or mark them for further analysis. For this notebook, we will demonstrate how to remove the rows containing outliers from both the training and test sets.\n"
