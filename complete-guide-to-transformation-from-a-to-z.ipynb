It involves adjusting the values of numerical features to ensure they have a common scale, which can improve the performance and training stability of machine learning models. In this section, we will explore various normalization techniques and demonstrate how to apply them using practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normalize Features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization can help in:\n",
    "- **Improving Model Performance**: Algorithms such as gradient descent converge faster with normalized data.\n",
    "- **Enhancing Accuracy**: Normalization can reduce the impact of features with larger scales on the model.\n",
    "- **Stability**: Models can become more stable and less sensitive to variations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques Covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Min-Max Scaling**: This technique scales the features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1]. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   X' = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Z-Score Standardization**: Also known as standardization, this method transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   X' = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Robust Scaling**: This method scales features using statistics that are robust to outliers, such as the median and the interquartile range. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   X' = \\frac{X - Q2}{Q3 - Q1}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where \\(Q1\\) and \\(Q3\\) are the 1st and 3rd quartiles, respectively, and \\(Q2\\) is the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Yeo-Johnson Transformation**: This technique can handle both positive and negative values and transforms the data to be more normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Box-Cox Transformation**: This method works with positive values and transforms the data to be more normally distributed, reducing skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Split Train and Test Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting the data into training and testing sets is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline. It ensures that the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data, providing a more realistic estimate of its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By keeping the test data separate:\n",
    "- **Avoid Data Leakage**: Ensures that information from the test set does not influence the model during training.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Provides an unbiased evaluation metric for how well the model generalizes to new data.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Helps in tuning model parameters by validating performance on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to apply these transformations to our dataset after splitting the data into training and testing sets.\n"

    "# 2. Feature Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature construction involves creating new features from existing ones to enhance the predictive power of your models. This can be done using domain knowledge, statistical relationships between features, and various encoding techniques. In this section, we will explore various methods of feature construction and demonstrate how to apply them using practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Construct New Features?\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing new features can help in:\n",
    "- **Improving Model Performance**: New features can provide additional information that helps the model make better predictions.\n",
    "- **Capturing Non-Linear Relationships**: Interactions and transformations of existing features can capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- **Reducing Dimensionality**: Aggregating features can reduce the number of dimensions, making models simpler and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques Covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use of Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate insights from the specific field or industry to construct meaningful features.\n",
    "2. **Using Statistical Relationships Between Features**: Identify and utilize correlations and interactions between features.\n",
    "3. **Numerical Coding of Nominal Values**:\n",
    "   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into a series of binary variables.\n",
    "   - **Ordinal or Label Encoding**: Assign integer values to categories based on their order or labels.\n",
    "   - **Probability Ratio Encoding**: Encode categorical features based on the probability ratio of the target variable.\n",

Each category in the original variable is represented as a separate column, with a 1 indicating the presence of that category and a 0 indicating its absence. This technique is useful when there is no ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
