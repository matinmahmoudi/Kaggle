    "# ðŸ§© Complete Guide to Statistical Testing A to Z\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive guide on statistical testing, designed to equip you with everything you need to know from basic concepts to advanced applications in data science. Whether you're a budding data scientist or a seasoned professional looking to refine your statistical analysis skills, this notebook is tailored for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Will You Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will explore a variety of statistical tests, each serving a unique purpose in data analysis, ensuring you have the tools to confidently tackle any data-driven challenge. Here's what we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Test:** Understand how to test relationships between categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Two-Sample T-Test & Paired T-Test:** Learn to compare means from different groups to decipher statistical significance in their differences.\n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Dive into testing differences across multiple groups simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Test of Correlation:** Discover the relationships and associations between continuous variables.\n",
    "- **Non-Parametric Tests:** Gain insights into methods that do not assume a specific data distribution, ideal for non-normal datasets.\n",
    "- **A/B Testing (Continuous & Boolean Outcomes):** Master the art of comparing two versions of a variable to determine the better performing one in both continuous and binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Guide?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Each section includes clear explanations followed by practical examples, ensuring you not only learn but also apply your knowledge.\n",
    "- **Interactive Learning:** Engage with interactive code cells that allow you to see the effects of statistical tests in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare to unlock the full potential of statistical testing in data science. Let's dive in and transform data into decisions!\n"
