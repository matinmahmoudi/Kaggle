    "# Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test determines whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Chi-Square Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-parametric test that assesses whether observed frequency distributions align with expected distributions under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use the Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables are categorical.\n",
    "- Sample data is randomly drawn.\n",
    "- Expected frequency for each cell is at least 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data should be randomly sampled.\n",
    "2. Each expected frequency should be at least 5. If not, use Fisher's Exact Test for small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses for Chi-Square Test for Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No association between the categorical variables (independent).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: An association exists between the categorical variables (not independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Displays the frequency distribution of variables.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Chi-Square Statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where \\( O_i \\) is the observed frequency and \\( E_i \\) is the expected frequency.\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the Chi-Square statistic to a Chi-Square distribution with degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   df = (r-1) \\times (c-1)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: If the p-value is ≤ 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio measures the association between two categorical variables. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure compared to the odds of the outcome occurring without that exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio is particularly useful when you have found a significant association between two categorical variables using the Chi-Square Test or Fisher's Exact Test. It helps to quantify the strength and direction of the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2x2 contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                | Outcome Present (Yes) | Outcome Absent (No) |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Exposure (Yes) | \\( a \\)                | \\( b \\)             |\n",
    "| No Exposure    | \\( c \\)                | \\( d \\)             |\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio (OR) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Odds Ratio} = \\frac{(a \\cdot d)}{(b \\cdot c)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( a \\) = Number of cases with exposure and outcome present\n",
    "- \\( b \\) = Number of cases with exposure and outcome absent\n",
    "- \\( c \\) = Number of cases without exposure and outcome present\n",
    "- \\( d \\) = Number of cases without exposure and outcome absent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio > 1**: Positive association between the variables.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio = 1**: No association between the variables.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio < 1**: Negative association between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Chi-Square Test for Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Group` and `Purchase_Made` variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: An association exists between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Summarize the data.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Chi-Square Statistic**: Use observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the statistic to the Chi-Square distribution.\n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: Based on the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Statistic**: Measures the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "- **p-value**: Probability of observing the test results under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Degrees of Freedom**: Calculated as (rows - 1) * (columns - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant association. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Odds Ratio Interpretation\n",

    "- **Odds Ratio > 1**: Positive association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio = 1**: No association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio < 1**: Negative association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fisher's Exact Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Exact Test is an alternative to the Chi-Square Test when the sample size is small, or the expected frequency assumption is not met. Though we meet the conditions for the Chi-Square Test in this example, we'll demonstrate Fisher's Exact Test for practice purposes. Note that Fisher's Exact Test is only applicable for 2x2 contingency tables.\n",

    "## Continuous Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the outcome is continuous, such as sales or scores, we use statistical tests like the independent samples t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Continuous Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "2. **Normality**: The data follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - If normality is not met, use a non-parametric test like the Mann-Whitney U test.\n",
    "3. **Homogeneity of Variances**: Variances of the two groups are equal.\n",
    "   - If variances are not equal, use Welch’s t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boolean Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "When the outcome is boolean (yes/no), we use the Chi-Square test for independence or Fisher's Exact test to compare the proportions of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Boolean Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "2. **Expected Frequency**: Each expected frequency should be at least 5.\n",
    "   - If expected frequencies are less than 5, use Fisher's Exact Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide for A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - **Normality**: Use Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity of Variances**: Use Levene’s test.\n",
    "2. **Perform the Appropriate Test**:\n",
    "   - **t-test**: If normality and homogeneity of variances are met.\n",
    "   - **Welch’s t-test**: If variances are not equal.\n",
    "   - **Mann-Whitney U test**: If normality is not met.\n",
    "3. **Interpret Results**: Compare the p-value to the significance level (α = 0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Summarize the data.\n",
    "2. **Perform the Appropriate Test**:\n",
    "   - **Chi-Square Test**: If expected frequencies are at least 5.\n",
    "   - **Fisher's Exact Test**: If expected frequencies are less than 5.\n",
    "3. **Interpret Results**: Compare the p-value to the significance level (α = 0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A/B Testing\n",
