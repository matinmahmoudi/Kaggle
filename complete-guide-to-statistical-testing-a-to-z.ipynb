    "# Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test determines whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Chi-Square Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-parametric test that assesses whether observed frequency distributions align with expected distributions under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use the Chi-Square Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables are categorical.\n",
    "- Sample data is randomly drawn.\n",
    "- Expected frequency for each cell is at least 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data should be randomly sampled.\n",
    "2. Each expected frequency should be at least 5. If not, use Fisher's Exact Test for small sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses for Chi-Square Test for Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No association between the categorical variables (independent).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: An association exists between the categorical variables (not independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Displays the frequency distribution of variables.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Chi-Square Statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where \\( O_i \\) is the observed frequency and \\( E_i \\) is the expected frequency.\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the Chi-Square statistic to a Chi-Square distribution with degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   df = (r-1) \\times (c-1)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: If the p-value is ≤ 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Size Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each statistical test has a unique sample size formula. However, to avoid complexity in some exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks, we use a sample size of 10,000, which is generally sufficient for robust statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Multiple Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have more than two groups in each variable, it may be better to merge them based on residuals to simplify the analysis, especially when the sample size is small and the expected frequencies are less than 5 in some cells. The residuals help us identify which groups can be combined without losing significant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Residuals help in understanding the contribution of each cell to the overall Chi-Square statistic. They are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Residual} = O_i - E_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( O_i \\) is the observed frequency and \\( E_i \\) is the expected frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio measures the association between two categorical variables. It represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure compared to the odds of the outcome occurring without that exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio is particularly useful when you have found a significant association between two categorical variables using the Chi-Square Test or Fisher's Exact Test. It helps to quantify the strength and direction of the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 2x2 contingency table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|                | Outcome Present (Yes) | Outcome Absent (No) |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Exposure (Yes) | \\( a \\)                | \\( b \\)             |\n",
    "| No Exposure    | \\( c \\)                | \\( d \\)             |\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio (OR) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Odds Ratio} = \\frac{(a \\cdot d)}{(b \\cdot c)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( a \\) = Number of cases with exposure and outcome present\n",
    "- \\( b \\) = Number of cases with exposure and outcome absent\n",
    "- \\( c \\) = Number of cases without exposure and outcome present\n",
    "- \\( d \\) = Number of cases without exposure and outcome absent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the Odds Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio > 1**: Positive association between the variables.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio = 1**: No association between the variables.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio < 1**: Negative association between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Chi-Square Test for Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Group` and `Purchase_Made` variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: An association exists between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Summarize the data.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Chi-Square Statistic**: Use observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the statistic to the Chi-Square distribution.\n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: Based on the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chi-Square Statistic**: Measures the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies.\n",
    "- **p-value**: Probability of observing the test results under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Degrees of Freedom**: Calculated as (rows - 1) * (columns - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant association. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Odds Ratio Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio > 1**: Positive association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio = 1**: No association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "- **Odds Ratio < 1**: Negative association between `Group` and `Purchase_Made`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fisher's Exact Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's Exact Test is an alternative to the Chi-Square Test when the sample size is small, or the expected frequency assumption is not met. Though we meet the conditions for the Chi-Square Test in this example, we'll demonstrate Fisher's Exact Test for practice purposes. Note that Fisher's Exact Test is only applicable for 2x2 contingency tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Fisher's Exact Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same `Group` and `Purchase_Made` variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Contingency Table**: Summarize the data.\n",
    "2. **Perform Fisher's Exact Test**: Calculate the exact p-value.\n",

    "# Independent Samples T-Test (Two-Sample T-Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Independent Samples T-Test, also known as the Two-Sample T-Test, determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Independent Samples T-Test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A parametric test that compares the means of two independent groups to see if they are significantly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use the Independent Samples T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent variable is continuous.\n",
    "- The independent variable consists of two categorical, independent groups.\n",
    "- Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed in each group.\n",
    "- Homogeneity of variances: The variances in the two groups are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group.\n",
    "   - If the sample size is large (n > 30), we can skip the normality check due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the distribution of the population, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.\n",
    "   - If normality is not met and the sample size is small, consider using a non-parametric test such as the Mann-Whitney U Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "   - If homogeneity of variances is not met, use Welch's T-Test, which does not assume equal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses for Independent Samples T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The means of the two groups are equal.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The means of the two groups are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Assumptions**: Verify normality (if the sample size is small) and homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the T-Test Statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   where $(\\bar{X}_1)$ and $(\\bar{X}_2)$ are the sample means, and $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the T-Test statistic to a t-distribution with degrees of freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   df = n_1 + n_2 - 2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: If the p-value is ≤ 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Independent Samples T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Sales_Before` variable to compare `Control` and `Treatment` groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The mean `Sales_Before` in the `Control` group is equal to the mean `Sales_Before` in the `Treatment` group.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The mean `Sales_Before` in the `Control` group is not equal to the mean `Sales_Before` in the `Treatment` group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Assumptions**: Verify normality (if sample size is small) and homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the T-Test Statistic**: Use the sample means, variances, and sizes.\n",
    "3. **Determine the p-value**: Compare the statistic to a t-distribution.\n",
    "4. **Interpret the Results**: Based on the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-Test Statistic**: Measures the difference between group means relative to the variability in the groups.\n",
    "- **p-value**: Probability of observing the test results under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Degrees of Freedom**: Calculated using the formula above.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis, indicating a significant difference between the means. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n"

    "## What is ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "A parametric test that compares the means of three or more independent groups to see if at least one of the group means is significantly different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent variable is continuous.\n",
    "- The independent variable consists of three or more categorical, independent groups.\n",
    "- Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed in each group.\n",
    "- Homogeneity of variances: The variances in the groups are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The dependent variable is normally distributed in each group.\n",
    "   - If normality is not met, consider using a non-parametric test such as the Kruskal-Wallis Test.\n",
    "2. Homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "   - If homogeneity of variances is not met, use Welch's ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses for ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: All group means are equal.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: At least one group mean is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Assumptions**: Verify normality and homogeneity of variances.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the ANOVA F-Statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   F = \\frac{\\text{between-group variability}}{\\text{within-group variability}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Pairwise Wilcoxon (Dunn's) Test for Kruskal-Wallis\n",

    "- The matrix contains p-values for pairwise comparisons between groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "A statistical method used to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use a Correlation Test\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both variables are continuous.\n",
    "- The relationship between the variables is linear.\n",
    "- Data pairs are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Correlation Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pearson Correlation**: Measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. Assumes both variables are normally distributed.\n",
    "   - If normality is not met, use Spearman's Rank Correlation.\n",
